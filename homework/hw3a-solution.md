# HW3A Solution – Git and Version Control

## Part 1: Repository Cloning
I successfully cloned the class repository from  
`https://github.com/olearydj/INSY6500`  
to my local directory:  
`~/insy6500/class_repo`

This allowed me to access all course materials, including assignments, datasets, and example notebooks.

### Key Commands Used
- `git clone <url>` – Create a local copy of a remote repository  
- `git log` – View commit history and author information  
- `git remote -v` – Check connected remote repositories and their URLs  
- `git status` – Display current branch and file tracking status  
- `git pull` – Fetch and merge the latest updates from the remote repository

## Part 2: Portfolio Repository Creation
I created my **personal course repository** named `my_repo` to maintain all of my coursework and projects in a structured and version-controlled manner.

### Repository Features
- **Professional `README.md`** describing the project purpose and structure  
- **Proper `.gitignore` file** to exclude unnecessary files such as temporary Jupyter notebook checkpoints, cache folders, and data logs  
- **Organized directory structure** separating homework, projects, and notes

## Part 3: Understanding Git Workflow
Git follows a three-stage workflow that tracks and manages changes efficiently.

 1. Working Directory: Where I edit files
 2. Staging Area: Where I prepare commits with `git add`
 3. Repository: Where commits are permanently stored with `git commit`
